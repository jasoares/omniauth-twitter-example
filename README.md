This is an example of Omniauth (1.0) with Twitter integration.
It was inspired by a discussion the boston.rb mailing list, specifically:

This is the simplest Rails 3.0 + Omniauth 1.0 app I could come up with. After you authorize, it can tweet a message on your behalf.

Look at it for the following

  * session creation with omniauth
  * using the twitter gem to communicate with Twitter

Don't look at it for anything else :) (like testing).
